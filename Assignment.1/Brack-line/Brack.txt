Q3.
 Write an HTML program that includes a heading, a paragraph of text, a horizontal line, and a line break.
Arrange these elements to create a simple web page layout.

Solution:

<hr> and <br> tags are used in HTML to create a horizontal line and a single line break, respectively. The <hr> tag creates a line across the page and has no closing tag. The <br> tag creates a line break within a block of text, so the text will start on a new line.
Example:
index.html
